/**
 * A module, which allows to generate association rules from frequent item sets. An association rule
 * specifies, that if certain items occur in a transaction, other items do also occur with a certain
 * probability. Among all possible association rules, which can be generated from the frequent item
 * sets, only those, whose "interestingly" according to the confidence metric is greater or equal
 * than a specific threshold, are taken into account.
 *
 * In order to prune the search for association rules, the algorithm exploits the anti-monotonicity
 * property of the confidence metric, which states, that the confidence of the rule A,B -&gt; C is
 * an upper bound to the confidence of a rule A -&gt; B,C. Consequently, the algorithm starts by
 * generating rules, which contain a single item in there heads. Based on those rules, which reach
 * the minimum confidence, additional rules are created by moving items from their bodies to the
 * heads. For each rule said process is continued until the minimum threshold cannot be reached
 * anymore.
 *
 * @param <ItemType> The type of the items, which are processed by the algorithm
