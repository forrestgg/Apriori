/**
 * A metric, which measures the leverage of an association rule. By definition, leverage is the
 * difference between the rule's support and the expected support for the body and head, if they
 * were independent. Furthermore, the leverage of a rule is a lower bound for its support. As a
 * consequence, in contrast to optimizing confidence or lift, optimizing the leverage of a rule
 * guarantees a certain minimum support.
